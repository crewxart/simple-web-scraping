# simple web scraping
 A simple web scraping with Beautiful Soup.
 
 #What's Web Scraping?
 It's a traditional method to extract internet pages (html) information.
 
 First, we send a get query to the website; this return an HTML based document contain all of the website information.
 
 Then, the next step is parsing.
 and finally, extract the data that I need (parcial qualifications of my current semester).
 
 I need 3 libraries
 - Requests, Beautiful soup, lxml.
 
 In my terminal:
 pip install requests #It's used for create the get query.
 pip install lxml #It's used for processing the html
 pip install beautifulsoup4 # it's used to create a parsed and navigable html document.
